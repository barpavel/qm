    and outside of the QM partition.
description: |
    This tests confirms that /run/systemd/journal/socket have different inode number inside
    and outside of the QM partition.
    The test gets inode number of /run/systemd/journal/socket inside and outside of the QM partition
    using `stat --printf='%i' /run/systemd/journal/socket` and `podman exec qm stat --printf='%i' /run/systemd/journal/socket`
    respectively and checks to ensure these are different values.
    Test inputs:
        None

    Expected results:
        out: [ INFO  ] PASS: check_run_systemd_journal_socket_inode_number: As expected, /run/systemd/journal/socket have different inode number inside and outside of the QM partition
